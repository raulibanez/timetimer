# Time Timer Tutorial 🕒

## Overview 🌐

Welcome to our Time Timer Tutorial – a playful yet practical project that harnesses the powers of ChatGPT, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 🎨 This app was designed with the guidance of ChatGPT to teach K12 students about the possibilities of AI.

**Note:** This project was originally hosted on Glitch but has been migrated to GitHub Pages as Glitch is no longer available. The app is now fully open-source and hosted here for anyone to try and learn from.

## Features ✨

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Sleek, straightforward, and no-nonsense.
- **Customizable Timer:** Set the timer to match your schedule or mood. ⏳
- **Audio Alert:** A gentle chime to let you know when time's up. 🔔
